# If I were to make a course on DevOps, what would it look like?

## Rough Ideas



*What is at the heart of DevOps?*

Between 2 companies the role of DevOps Engineer was very similar. This may be surprising given that it has such a broad definition, but broadness is kind of the essence of DevOps.

To be a DevOps Engineer you have to do 2 things:

* Become comfortable with learning new things - i.e. become comfortable with the discomfort that learning generally brings.
* Laterally notice similarities and patterns across systems.

*Why is this the case?*
As I mentioned, DevOps is all about being able to work with a broad set of technologies; learning those technologies efficiently, and implementing them within your infrastructure such that they align with pre-existing patterns. The greater goal is to facilitate your frontend and backend engineers in such a way they they can quickly and safely iterate, test, and deploy code to production.

*Okay, but what specifically do DevOps Engineers do?*
Why do DevOps engineers command high salaries like other types of software engineers?
And what will I learn in this course?

* We build out CI/CD pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy code when a developer pushes it to a remote repository like GitHub.
* We configure cloud infrastructure as code using technologies like Terraform.
* We deploy Kubernetes clusters to run applications in a highly available way - making those applications fast to access for customers worldwide, while staying resilient to even the worst of natural disasters.
* We are responsible for infrastructure/network security and implementing the tools to monitor and defend against attackers.
* And occasionally we are also tech support for the less bash/terminal inclined members of our team.

As you can see, this is quite the torch to bear! Luckily, you have this course to help guide you along your journey.

## What can be done to accomplish them?

* Design a Course Outline. Can use DevOps roadmap. Pick top two (ish) items from each area to cover.
* For each piece/section, write a course with included code examples and diagrams.
  * Figure out best way to record diagrams. Maybe get a drawing pad for PC and record screen?
* Write a script for each section. Showing screen caps (with me recorded in corner, like a Twitch stream)
  * For certain parts it can just be me in the video, or just a white board if I am drawing a diagram.
